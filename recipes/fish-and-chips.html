        <h2>What is Fish and Chips?</h2>
        <p>Fish and chips is a traditional British dish consisting of fried fish and thinly sliced fried potatoes.</p>
        <p>The potatoes are called "French fries" in the U.S. and "chips" in the U.K.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into strips</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
